# AFFORDABLE HOUSING CODE PROVISIONS
## 20 NW 76 STREET - 4-STORY AFFORDABLE/WORKFORCE HOUSING

**Project Type:** Affordable/Workforce Housing
**Review Date:** November 12, 2025

---

## ✅ AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVISIONS ALREADY APPLIED

### 1. PARKING REDUCTION ✓ CORRECTLY APPLIED

**Standard Requirement:** 1.0-1.5 spaces/unit (Miami 21 typical residential)

**Affordable Housing Rate:** 0.5 spaces/unit (Miami 21 Art. 4, Table 3, Note 1(C))

**Your Project:**
- 6 units × 4 floors = 24 units
- 24 units × 0.5 = **12 spaces required**
- **WAIT - Need to verify your actual parking count**
- Zoning data shows: 3 residential + 1 guest + 1 accessible = **5 spaces total**

**⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUE:** If 24 units total, should be:
- Residential: 12 spaces (24 × 0.5)
- Guest: 1.2 spaces (10% of 12) = 2 spaces
- Accessible: 1 space (per FBC)
- **Total: 15 spaces required?**

**ACTION NEEDED:** Verify actual unit count and parking calculation

## 📋 AFFORDABLE HOUSING CODE EXCEPTIONS TO RESEARCH

### UNIT SIZE REQUIREMENTS

**Standard Miami 21 Requirements:**
- Minimum 400 SF/unit (Studio/1BR)
- Minimum 650 SF average (all units)
- Minimum 900 SF (3+ bedroom units)

**Affordable Housing Potential Exceptions:**

1. **HUD/FHA Minimum Standards** (if HUD-financed):
   - Studio: 400 SF minimum (same as Miami 21)
   - 1 BR: 550 SF minimum
   - 2 BR: 750 SF minimum
   - 3 BR: 950 SF minimum
   - Note: These are HUD minimums, Miami 21 may still apply

2. **Florida Statutes Chapter 420** (Affordable Housing):
   - May have specific size requirements
   - May allow smaller units if meeting affordability criteria
   - Need to verify if project qualifies under this statute

3. **Miami 21 Affordable Housing Bonus**:
   - May allow increased density
   - May allow reduced unit sizes
   - Need to check if formal affordable housing agreement exists

**ACTION NEEDED:**
- Confirm if project has formal affordable housing designation
- Verify which affordable housing program (HUD, Florida 420, Miami local, etc.)
- Confirm applicable unit size minimums for the specific program

## 🔍 ITEMS TO VERIFY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

### 1. ACTUAL UNIT COUNT

**Need to confirm:**
- How many total units? (Zoning says 6, but per floor or total?)
- Unit mix: How many studios, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR?

### 2. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM

**Need to confirm which program applies:**
- HUD/FHA financing?
- Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC)?
- Miami-Dade County Affordable Housing Program?
- Local inclusionary zoning requirement?
- LIHTC (Low Income Housing Tax Credit)?
- Private affordable housing (market-rate with affordability commitment)?

**Why this matters:**
- Different programs have different size/design requirements
- Some programs have stricter requirements than code minimums
- Documentation requirements vary by program

### 3. UNIT SIZE MINIMUMS

**Once program is confirmed, verify:**
- Minimum unit sizes per program requirements
- Average unit size requirements
- Whether Miami 21 minimums still apply or are superseded

### 4. PARKING CALCULATION VERIFICATION

**Need to recalculate based on:**
- Confirmed unit count
- Affordable housing rate: 0.5 spaces/unit
- Guest parking: 10% of required spaces
- Accessible parking: Per FBC Table 1106.1

## 📊 REVISED CRITICAL ISSUES

Based on affordable housing designation, here are the **CONFIRMED CRITICAL ISSUES** (no exceptions):

### CRITICAL ISSUE #1: WALL FIRE RATINGS ❌ NO EXCEPTION
**Status:** STILL CRITICAL - Zero-hour walls are non-compliant
**Requirement:** 1-hour (units/corridors), 2-hour (stairs)
**Affordable Housing Exception:** NONE - Life safety requirements fully apply

### CRITICAL ISSUE #2: DOOR SCHEDULE INCOMPLETE ❌ NO EXCEPTION
**Status:** STILL CRITICAL - Fire ratings and hardware required
**Requirement:** Complete specifications with fire ratings
**Affordable Housing Exception:** NONE - Fire safety requirements fully apply

### CRITICAL ISSUE #3: ROOM AREAS NOT CALCULATED ⚠️ PARTIAL EXCEPTION POSSIBLE
**Status:** STILL CRITICAL - Need areas to verify any code compliance
**Requirement:** Must calculate to verify applicable minimums
**Affordable Housing Exception:** Size minimums MAY be different, but still need to calculate areas

**ACTION:** Calculate areas, then verify against correct affordable housing program minimums

## 📝 UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **Clarify Project Details:**
   - Confirm total unit count (6 or 24?)
   - Confirm unit mix (studios, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR count)
   - Identify specific affordable housing program
   - Obtain program requirements documentation

2. **Verify Parking Calculation:**
   - Recalculate based on confirmed unit count
   - May need more than 5 spaces currently shown

3. **Fix Fire Safety Issues (No Exceptions):**
   - Wall fire ratings → 1-hour/2-hour as required
   - Door schedule → Complete with fire ratings
   - All egress requirements → Full compliance required

4. **Calculate Unit Sizes:**
   - Enable room area calculations
   - Calculate total unit sizes
   - Compare against applicable affordable housing program minimums
   - Verify against Miami 21 (if still applicable)

5. **Accessibility Compliance (No Exceptions):**
   - Type A unit requirements fully apply
   - All accessibility features required

## 🎯 QUESTIONS FOR USER:

To provide accurate code review for affordable housing:

1. **What is the total unit count?**

## ✅ BOTTOM LINE

**What DOES get exceptions for affordable housing:**
- ✓ Parking reduced to 0.5 spaces/unit (already applied)
- ? Unit sizes may have different minimums (need to verify program)
- ? Density may be increased (if formal agreement exists)

**What DOES NOT get exceptions:**
- ❌ Fire ratings (walls, doors, floors)
- ❌ Egress requirements (travel distance, widths, exits)
- ❌ Accessibility (Type A units, parking, features)
- ❌ Building code minimums (ceiling heights, room sizes)
- ❌ Life safety systems (sprinklers, fire alarm)

**Your affordable housing designation helps with parking and potentially unit sizes, but all fire/life safety and accessibility requirements still fully apply.**
