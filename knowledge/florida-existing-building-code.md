## Quick Reference - Work Categories

| Work Type | Description | Code Compliance |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Repair | Restore to good condition | Materials to current code |
| Alteration Level 1 | Removal/replacement | Element to current code |
| Alteration Level 2 | Reconfiguration | Area to current code |
| Alteration Level 3 | > 50% of building | Extensive upgrades |
| Addition | New floor area | New work to current code |
| Change of Occupancy | Different use | May trigger full compliance |

---

## Compliance Methods (Chapter 3)

### Three Compliance Paths

#### 1. Prescriptive Compliance (Chapter 4-13)
- **Most common method**
- Work category determines requirements
- Limited scope = limited upgrades

#### 2. Work Area Method (Chapter 4-12)
- Alternative prescriptive approach
- Based on percentage of building affected
- Graduated requirements

#### 3. Performance Compliance (Chapter 14)
- Building evaluated as whole
- Points-based system
- Flexibility for historic buildings
