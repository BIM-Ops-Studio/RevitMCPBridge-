# Problem-Solving Patterns - Common Issues & Solutions

## Spatial Problems

### "The ceiling is too low for ducts"
**Causes:**
- Floor-to-floor height too short
- Large duct mains
- Beam locations conflict

**Solutions:**
1. Route ducts in bulkhead/soffit (show on RCP)
2. Use high-velocity small duct system
3. Route main ducts in corridor (lower corridor ceiling)
4. Consider split systems (no large ducts)
5. Raise floor-to-floor if in design phase

### "The beam is in the middle of the room"
**Causes:**
- Long span requires beam
- Structural grid doesn't match architectural

**Solutions:**
1. Accept and box out (architectural feature)
2. Recess into floor above (if depth allows)
3. Use transfer beam at different location
4. Use larger member that's shallower
5. Add column (changes architectural layout)

### "There's no room for the stair"
**Causes:**
- Building footprint too small
- Wrong stair type selected

**Solutions:**
1. Calculate minimum: Rise/Riser × Tread = Run
2. Use switchback stair (reduces length)
3. Use winder stairs (saves 3'-4')
4. Consider circular/spiral (code limits)
5. Steal space from adjacent room

### "The bathroom doesn't fit"
**Causes:**
- Room too small for required fixtures
- Door swing conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Change door to swing out or pocket
2. Use corner toilet
3. Use wall-hung toilet (saves 4"-6")
4. Use pedestal sink instead of vanity
5. Combine tub/shower (single fixture)
6. Minimum: 5' × 8' for full bath

## Code Compliance Problems

### "Not enough exits"
**Causes:**
- Occupant load requires 2+ exits
- Travel distance exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Add exit door (preferred)
2. Reduce occupant load (change use)
3. Add sprinklers (increases travel distance)
4. Create horizontal exit (fire-rated)
5. Add exterior stair

### "Corridor is too narrow"
**Causes:**
- 44" required but only 42" available

**Solutions:**
1. Borrow space from adjacent rooms
2. Remove door swings from corridor
3. Use pocket or sliding doors
4. Reroute corridor
5. Check if 36" allowed (< 50 occupants)

### "Bathroom isn't accessible"
**Causes:**
- 60" turning radius not available
- Clear floor space conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Enlarge bathroom
2. Change door to swing out
3. Relocate fixtures
4. Use wall-hung fixtures (more floor space)
5. Change layout to linear (long narrow)

### "Stair risers are too high"
**Causes:**
- Floor-to-floor height ÷ risers = too tall

**Solutions:**
1. Add more risers (longer run needed)
2. Reduce floor-to-floor height
3. Add landing and turn (fit more risers)
4. Use two separate runs

## Budget Problems

### "We need to cut costs"
**Value Engineering Options (by impact):**

**Low Impact (try first):**
- Reduce window sizes (not quantity)
- Change tile to LVT/LVP
- Change solid wood doors to hollow core
- Reduce cabinet hardware quality
- Use standard sizes (avoid custom)

**Medium Impact:**
- Reduce ceiling height (9' to 8')
- Simplify roof form (reduce valleys)
- Use vinyl windows vs aluminum
- Reduce number of plumbing fixtures
- Combine bathroom vent fans

**High Impact (last resort):**
- Reduce square footage
- Eliminate full bath (go to 3/4)
- Change structure type
- Reduce number of stories
- Use slab instead of crawl space

### "Client wants to add a feature"
**Questions to ask:**
1. What is the budget impact?
2. Does it affect structure?
3. Does it affect MEP?
4. Does it affect permitting timeline?
5. Does it affect code compliance?

**If client insists:**
- Document change in writing
- Get sign-off on cost/time impact
- Issue change order/addendum

## Coordination Problems

### "Structural and Architectural don't match"
**Common conflicts:**
- Grid lines offset
- Column sizes different
- Beam depths not coordinated
- Floor openings don't align

**Solutions:**
1. Identify source of truth (usually structural)
2. Overlay drawings to find conflicts
3. Meeting with structural engineer
4. Document resolution in meeting notes
5. Update architectural to match (usually)

### "MEP doesn't fit"
**Common conflicts:**
- Ducts don't fit in ceiling
- Plumbing doesn't fit in walls
- Electrical panels in wrong location

**Solutions:**
1. Create composite overlay
2. Hold coordination meeting
3. Adjust ceiling heights (bulkheads)
4. Thicken walls for plumbing
5. Relocate equipment
6. Document agreed solution

### "The window moved but the schedule didn't update"
**Prevention:**
- Use Revit schedules linked to model
- Run schedule vs. model check
- Mark/number windows on plans

**Fix:**
- Review all windows against schedule
- Update schedule to match model
- Re-tag any untagged windows

## Construction Problems

### "Field conditions don't match drawings"
**Common issues:**
- As-built dimensions differ
- Hidden conditions discovered
- Survey was inaccurate

**Solutions:**
1. Issue RFI for architect's direction
2. Site visit to assess
3. Issue ASI (Architect's Supplemental Instruction)
4. Revise drawings if significant
5. Document with photographs

### "Material is no longer available"
**Solutions:**
1. Find equivalent substitute
2. Document substitution request
3. Verify substitute meets specs
4. Approve or reject in writing
5. Update drawings if significant

### "The contractor has a better idea"
**Evaluate based on:**
1. Does it meet code?
2. Does it meet intent?
3. Does it affect cost?
4. Does it affect warranty?
5. Does it affect future maintenance?

**If acceptable:**
- Document approval in writing
- Possibly credit owner for savings
- Update as-builts

## Design Problems

### "The floor plan doesn't work"
**Check these issues:**
1. Circulation clear?
2. Room proportions reasonable?
3. Natural light adequate?
4. Privacy appropriate?
5. Furniture fits?
6. Storage adequate?

**Common fixes:**
- Flip rooms (bedroom to front, living to back)
- Combine spaces (open concept)
- Add interior windows (borrow light)
- Adjust door locations
- Create zones (public/private)

### "The elevation looks wrong"
**Check these proportions:**
1. Window patterns balanced?
2. Base/middle/top defined?
3. Roof pitch appropriate?
4. Entry clearly marked?
5. Scale of elements correct?

**Common fixes:**
- Align windows vertically
- Add base (water table, material change)
- Adjust roof pitch
- Add entry features (porch, canopy)
- Change window proportions

## Emergency Response

### "Permit is rejected"
**Common reasons:**
1. Missing information → Provide it
2. Code violation → Revise design
3. Zoning issue → Seek variance or redesign
4. Structural concern → Engineer's letter
5. Site issue → Additional survey/docs

### "Inspection failed"
**Architect's role:**
1. Get specific failure reasons
2. Determine if design error
3. If design error → RFI and fix
4. If construction error → Contractor fixes
5. Coordinate re-inspection

### "Client doesn't like the design"
**Questions:**
1. What specifically don't they like?
2. Is it fixable within scope?
3. Is additional fee required?
4. Document feedback in writing
5. Present options with implications
