# Wall Assemblies - When to Use What

## Decision Logic

### Exterior Wall Selection
```
Is it in Florida coastal zone?
  YES → CMU or reinforced concrete (hurricane)
  NO → Wood frame OK

Is fire rating required?
  YES → See fire-rated assemblies below
  NO → Standard assembly OK

Is it below grade?
  YES → Concrete or CMU with waterproofing
  NO → Standard assembly
```

### Interior Wall Selection
```
Is fire rating required?
  YES → Use rated assembly (1-hr or 2-hr)
  NO → Continue...

Is it a wet area (bathroom, kitchen, laundry)?
  YES → Moisture-resistant GWB (green board) or cement board
  NO → Standard GWB

Is sound control needed?
  YES → Add insulation + staggered studs or resilient channel
  NO → Standard assembly
```
