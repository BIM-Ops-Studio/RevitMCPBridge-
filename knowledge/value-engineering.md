# Value Engineering

## VE Overview

### Definition
Value Engineering (VE) is a systematic method to improve the "value" of a project by examining function and reducing cost while maintaining or improving quality, performance, and reliability.

### Value Formula
```
Value = Function / Cost

Where:
- Function = What the item does (primary purpose)
- Cost = Total lifecycle cost
- Higher value = Better function for lower cost
```

### VE Timing
| Phase | VE Opportunity | Savings Potential |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Programming | Highest | 10-25% |
| Schematic Design | High | 5-15% |
| Design Development | Medium | 3-10% |
| Construction Documents | Lower | 1-5% |
| Construction | Lowest | < 3% |
