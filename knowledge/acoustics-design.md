## Design Strategies

### Noise Control
1. **Source** - Reduce at source (quieter equipment)
2. **Path** - Block transmission (barriers, enclosures)
3. **Receiver** - Protect listener (isolation, distance)

### Room Shaping
- Avoid parallel surfaces (flutter echo)
- Splayed walls (5° minimum)
- Diffusion for even distribution
- Bass traps in corners

### Flanking Paths
| Path | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Above ceiling | Extend partition to deck |
| Through floor | Resilient connections |
| Around doors | Proper gasketing |
| Through ducts | Duct lining, silencers |
| Through electrical | Seal boxes, use putty pads |

## Acoustical Details

### Door Seals
- Perimeter gasketing (adjustable)
- Automatic door bottom
- Sound-rated door assembly
- Vestibule for critical spaces

### Window Considerations
- Laminated glass (damping)
- Different thickness panes (staggered resonance)
- Air space (minimum 4")
- Multiple layers for high STC

### Penetration Treatment
- Seal all penetrations airtight
- Mass loaded vinyl wrap
- Putty pads on electrical boxes
- Flexible connections for pipes
