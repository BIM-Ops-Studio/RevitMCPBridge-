# Site Design Fundamentals

## Zoning and Setbacks

### Common Setback Requirements
| Zone Type | Front | Side | Rear |
|-----------|-------|------|------|
| Single-family (R-1) | 25' | 7.5' | 20' |
| Multi-family (R-3) | 25' | 10' | 20' |
| Commercial (C-1) | 0-25' | 0-10' | 10' |
| Industrial (I-1) | 25' | 10' | 10' |

### Setback Exceptions (Common)
- Architectural projections (2' typical)
- Uncovered porches (may encroach 6')
- Bay windows (may encroach 2'-3')
- Cornices and eaves (2' typical)
- Mechanical equipment (varies)

### Height Limits
| Zone | Max Height | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Residential | 35' typical | 2-3 stories |
| Commercial | 35'-75' | Varies by zone |
| Downtown | Often unlimited | With bonuses |

---

## Grading and Drainage

### Slope Requirements
| Surface | Min Slope | Max Slope |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Away from building | 5% (6" in 10') | N/A |
| Lawn/landscape | 2% | 33% (3:1) |
| Swale | 1% | 5% |
| Parking lot | 1% | 5% |
| Accessible route | 2% cross, 5% running | Per ADA |
| Driveway | 2% | 12% (15% max) |

### Drainage Patterns
```
Sheet flow: 2% min across paved areas
Swale: 1% min longitudinal slope
Catch basin spacing: 300' max on grade

Volume calculation (rational method):
Q = C × I × A
Q = runoff (CFS)
C = runoff coefficient
I = rainfall intensity (in/hr)
A = area (acres)
```

### Runoff Coefficients
| Surface | C Value |
|---------|---------|
| Pavement | 0.85-0.95 |
| Gravel | 0.35-0.70 |
| Lawn (flat) | 0.10-0.20 |
| Lawn (steep) | 0.25-0.35 |
| Roofs | 0.75-0.95 |

### Retention/Detention
- Retention: permanent pond, infiltrates
- Detention: temporary storage, releases slowly
- Florida: often 1" of runoff over impervious area
- Calculate: Volume = Area × Depth (typically 6"-12")

## Stormwater Management

### Florida-Specific Requirements
- Treatment of first 1" of runoff
- 25-year, 24-hour storm detention
- Discharge rate ≤ pre-development
- Littoral shelf in retention ponds

### BMP Options

| Retention pond | Large | Monthly inspection |
| Detention pond | Large | Monthly inspection |
| Swale | Linear | Seasonal mowing |
| Exfiltration trench | Underground | Annual inspection |
| Pervious pavement | At paving | Vacuum annually |
| Rain garden | Moderate | Seasonal maintenance |

### Pond Sizing (Rule of Thumb)
```
Treatment volume: 1" × impervious area
Attenuation volume: varies by storm design

Example:
- 1 acre site, 50% impervious
- Treatment: 1" × 0.5 acre × 43,560 SF = 1,815 CF
- Pond: ~50' × 50' × 1.5' average depth
```
