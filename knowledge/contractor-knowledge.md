## RFI (Request for Information) Guidelines

### When RFIs Are Needed
- Detail or dimension not shown on drawings
- Conflict between documents (drawings vs specs)
- Field condition differs from drawings
- Substitution request
- Clarification of design intent
- Missing information for fabrication

### RFI Response Types
| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| See attached sketch | Provide ASI or sketch |
| Per specifications | Reference spec section |
| Verify in field | Site measurement needed |
| Approved as submitted | No change required |
| Revise as noted | Provide markup/revision |
| Defer to structural | Coordinate with consultant |

### Common RFI Topics

**Architectural**
- Door hardware conflicts
- Finish transitions
- Ceiling height at soffits
- Base/crown conditions at special walls
- Missing room finishes
- Casework details

**Structural**
- Embed locations
- Opening reinforcement
- Foundation step locations
- Steel connection details
- Beam penetrations

**MEP**
- Equipment pad sizes
- Access panel locations
- Duct routing conflicts
- Pipe penetrations through rated assemblies
- Electrical panel clearances

### RFI Best Practices
1. Respond within 3-5 business days (check contract)
2. Reference drawing and spec section
3. Provide sketch if clarification is graphic
4. Log response in project records
5. Issue ASI if response affects drawings
