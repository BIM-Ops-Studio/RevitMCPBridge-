## Keying

### Keying Systems
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|

### Master Key Hierarchy
```
Grand Master (GMK)
├── Master (MK1) - Floor 1
│   ├── Individual keys 101-110
├── Master (MK2) - Floor 2
│   ├── Individual keys 201-210
```

### Best Practices
- Limit master key levels (security decreases with more levels)
- Control key distribution
- Key records maintained
- Construction keys invalidated at turnover
