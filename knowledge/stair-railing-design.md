# Stairs and Railings

## Stair Geometry

### Dimensional Requirements
| Component | Residential | Commercial |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Riser height (max) | 7-3/4" | 7" |
| Tread depth (min) | 10" | 11" |
| Headroom (min) | 6'-8" | 6'-8" |
| Width (min) | 36" | 44" (varies by occ load) |
| Landing depth | Width of stair | Width of stair |

### Riser/Tread Relationship
```
2R + T = 24" to 25" (comfort formula)
R × T = 70 to 75 (alternate formula)

Example:
R = 7", T = 11"
2(7) + 11 = 25" ✓
7 × 11 = 77 (slightly high, but OK)
```

### Calculating Risers
```
Number of risers = Total rise / Target riser height

Example:
- Floor-to-floor: 9'-0" (108")
- Target riser: 7"
- Risers: 108 / 7 = 15.4 → 15 or 16 risers
- With 15 risers: 108 / 15 = 7.2" ✓
- With 16 risers: 108 / 16 = 6.75" ✓
```

### Variation Tolerances
| Dimension | Max Variation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Riser to riser | 3/8" |
| Tread to tread | 3/8" |
| Within flight | 3/8" largest to smallest |

### Minimum Widths by Use
