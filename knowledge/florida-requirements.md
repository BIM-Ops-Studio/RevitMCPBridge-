# Florida Building Code - Special Requirements

## Hurricane/Wind Requirements (FBC High Velocity Hurricane Zone)

### Wind Speed Zones (Florida)
| Location | Basic Wind Speed |
|----------|------------------|
| Miami-Dade, Broward | 180 mph |
| Palm Beach, Monroe | 170 mph |
| Most coastal | 150-160 mph |
| Inland | 130-140 mph |

### Impact-Rated Glazing Requirements
In HVHZ (High Velocity Hurricane Zone):
- ALL exterior glazing must be impact-rated OR
- Protected by approved hurricane shutters
- Large missile test: 9 lb 2x4 @ 50 fps
- Small missile test: 10 steel balls @ 50 fps

### Opening Protection
| Opening Type | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| Windows | Impact-rated or shutters |
| Entry doors | Impact-rated or shutters |
| Garage doors | Wind-rated + impact |
| Sliding glass | Impact-rated or shutters |
| Skylights | Impact-rated |

### Roof Requirements
- Roof-to-wall connections: Hurricane straps/clips
- Secondary water barrier required
- Miami-Dade NOA (Notice of Acceptance) required for products in HVHZ

## Flood Zone Requirements (FEMA/FBC)

### Flood Zone Designations
| Zone | Description | Requirements |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| AE | 100-year flood with BFE | Elevate to BFE + freeboard |
| VE | Coastal high hazard | Elevate + breakaway walls below |
| X | Minimal flood hazard | No special requirements |
| AH | Shallow flooding | Elevate to BFE |

### Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
- Lowest floor must be AT or ABOVE BFE
- Many jurisdictions require FREEBOARD (1' or 2' above BFE)
- Mechanical equipment above BFE
- Electrical panels above BFE

### Construction in Flood Zones
In AE zones:
- Enclosed areas below BFE must have flood vents
- Flood vent requirement: 1 SF per 150 SF enclosed area
- Minimum 2 openings on different walls
- Use flood-resistant materials below BFE

In VE zones (coastal):
- Structure must be on piles or columns
- No obstructions below lowest floor
- Breakaway walls only below BFE
- Open lattice or screening allowed

### Flood Vent Specifications
- Bottom of opening within 12" of grade
- Engineered flood vents: follow manufacturer
- Non-engineered: 1 SF per 150 SF of enclosed area
- Smart Vent, Crawl Space Door, or similar products

## Florida Energy Code (IECC + Florida Amendments)

### Insulation Requirements (Climate Zones 1-2)
| Component | Minimum R-Value |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Ceiling/Roof | R-30 |
| Wood frame wall | R-13 |
| Mass wall (CMU) | R-4 interior or R-8 exterior |
| Floor over unconditioned | R-13 |
| Slab edge | R-0 (not required in FL) |

### Window Requirements (U-Factor/SHGC)
| Climate Zone | U-Factor Max | SHGC Max |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Zone 1 (South FL) | 0.50 | 0.25 |
| Zone 2 (Central/North FL) | 0.40 | 0.25 |

### HVAC Requirements
- Minimum SEER rating: 15 (as of 2023)
- Duct leakage testing required
- Ducts in unconditioned space: R-8 minimum
- Programmable thermostat required

## Termite Protection (FBC Chapter 26)

### Required Protection Methods
1. Soil treatment (termiticide)
2. Pressure-treated wood
3. Physical barriers (termimesh, basaltic particle)
4. Bait systems

### Wood-to-Ground Clearances
| Element | Minimum Clearance |
|---------|-------------------|
| Untreated wood to grade | 8" |
| Untreated siding to grade | 6" |
| Treated wood to grade | 0" (OK to contact) |
| Wood structural to concrete | Use PT wood or barrier |

## Swimming Pool Requirements (Florida)

### Barrier Requirements
- Minimum height: 48" (4'-0")
- Maximum opening: 4" sphere cannot pass
- Self-closing, self-latching gates
- Latches minimum 54" AFF (outward opening)

### Pool Equipment
- All electrical: GFCI protected
- Bonding required for metal within 5'
- Suction entrapment protection required

## Florida-Specific QC Items

When reviewing Florida projects, verify:
- [ ] Wind speed noted on drawings
- [ ] Impact glazing or shutter schedule
- [ ] Flood zone identified
- [ ] BFE + freeboard shown on elevations
- [ ] Flood vents if enclosed area below BFE
- [ ] Energy code compliance path identified
- [ ] HVAC equipment locations above BFE (if in flood zone)
- [ ] Termite protection method noted
- [ ] Pool barrier shown (if applicable)
- [ ] Hurricane strap schedule (structural coordination)
