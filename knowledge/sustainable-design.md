- 50" annual rainfall
- 80% efficiency
= 2,000 × 50/12 × 0.80 × 7.48 = 49,800 gallons/year

## Renewable Energy

### Solar PV Sizing
```
Annual energy use ÷ Solar production per kW

Florida example:
- 100,000 kWh/year building
- 1,400 kWh/kW/year production
= 72 kW system needed for 100%

Space needed: ~6 SF per kW (efficient panels)
= 72 × 6 = 432 SF roof area
```

### Solar-Ready Requirements
- Designated roof area
