# Waterproofing Systems

## Waterproofing vs Dampproofing

### Definitions
| Type | Description | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Dampproofing | Moisture resistance, not hydrostatic | Soil moisture, no water table |
| Waterproofing | Full barrier against water pressure | Below water table, planters |

### When Waterproofing Required
- Habitable space below grade
- High water table
- Planter boxes and green roofs
- Below-grade parking
- Tunnels and subway structures
- Swimming pools
