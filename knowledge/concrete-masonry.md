## Florida/Hurricane Considerations

### Wind-Resistant CMU
- Solid grouted walls
- Increased reinforcement
- Bond beams at 4' max
- Continuous vertical bars
- Anchor bolts at top

### Flood Zone Requirements
- Flood vents in stem walls
- Water-resistant materials below BFE
- No breakaway walls (unless designed)
