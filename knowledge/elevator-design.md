## Traffic Analysis

### Handling Capacity
```
HC = (300 × P × RT) / I

HC = Handling capacity (persons/5 min)
P = Number of passengers per trip
RT = Round trip time (seconds)
I = Interval (seconds between cars)

Target: 12-15% of population in 5 minutes
```

### Population Estimates
| Use | Persons/1000 SF |
|-----|-----------------|
| Office | 8-10 |
| Residential | 2-3 per unit |
| Hotel | 1.5-2 per room |
| Hospital | 3-5 per bed |

### Number of Elevators
| Building Height | Minimum Elevators |
