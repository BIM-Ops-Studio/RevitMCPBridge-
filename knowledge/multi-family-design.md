## Corridor Design

### Double-Loaded Corridor
- Units on both sides
- Most efficient (70-75% efficiency)
- 5'-0" to 6'-0" width minimum

### Single-Loaded Corridor
- Units on one side only
- Less efficient (60-65%)
- Natural light to corridor
- Views to courtyard/exterior

### Point Tower/Skip-Stop
- Central core with 2-4 units per floor
- Very efficient for high-rise
- Premium units with corner exposure
