## Parking Calculations

### Ratios by Use (Typical)
| Use | Ratio |
|-----|-------|
| Office | 1 per 250-400 SF |
| Retail | 1 per 150-250 SF |
| Restaurant | 1 per 50-100 SF |
| Fast food | 1 per 30-50 SF |
| Medical office | 1 per 150-200 SF |
| Hospital | 1 per 2-3 beds |
| Church | 1 per 3-5 seats |
| Theater | 1 per 3-4 seats |
| Multi-family | 1-2 per unit |
| Hotel | 1 per room + 1 per 4 employees |
| Industrial | 1 per 500-1000 SF |

### Efficiency Calculations
```
Gross lot area × Efficiency factor = Net parking area
Net parking area ÷ SF per space = Total spaces

Typical efficiency factors:
- Surface lot: 300-350 SF/space
- Structured (90°): 350-400 SF/space
```

| One-way arrows | Aisles |
| Accessible parking | At spaces |
| Floor/zone ID | Structures |
| Emergency contact | Visible locations |

### Wayfinding (Structures)
- Floor numbers/colors
