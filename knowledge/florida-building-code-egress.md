### Retail (M)
- [ ] 30 sq ft per occupant (main floor)

## Formulas

### Egress Width Calculation
```
Egress width = Occupant load × Factor

Factors:
- Stairs: 0.3" per occupant
- Other components: 0.2" per occupant
- Sprinklered: 0.2" stairs, 0.15" other
```

### Example Calculation
```
Office building: 10,000 sq ft
Occupant load: 10,000 ÷ 150 = 67 occupants
Exit width needed: 67 × 0.2" = 13.4" → Use 32" min door
Number of exits: 2 (>49 occupants)
Separation: Half diagonal of floor
```
