## Escalation

### Calculating Escalation
```
Escalated Cost = Current Cost × (1 + Rate)^Years

Example:
Current: $10M
Rate: 5% annually
Midpoint: 18 months = 1.5 years
Escalated: $10M × (1.05)^1.5 = $10.76M
```

### Recent Escalation Rates
| Year | National | Florida |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2021 | 8-12% | 10-15% |
| 2022 | 10-15% | 12-18% |
