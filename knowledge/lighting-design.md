## Lamp Types

### LED (Standard Now)

| Linear LED | 100-150 | 50,000 hrs | 3000K-5000K |

### Color Temperature Guide
| Kelvin | Description | Use |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| 2200K | Candlelight | Restaurants, accent |
| 2700K | Warm white | Residential, hospitality |
| 3000K | Soft white | Residential, retail |
| 3500K | Neutral | Office, healthcare |
| 4000K | Cool white | Office, retail |
| 5000K | Daylight | Industrial, task |

### CRI (Color Rendering Index)
| CRI Range | Quality | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 90+ | Excellent | Retail, healthcare, residential |

## Lighting Calculations

### Lumen Method (Zonal Cavity)
```
Fixtures needed = (Area × FC required) / (Lumens per fixture × CU × LLF)

CU = Coefficient of Utilization (0.4-0.8 typical)
LLF = Light Loss Factor (0.7-0.9 typical)

Example:
- 400 SF office, 40 FC required
- Fixture: 4,000 lumens
- CU: 0.6, LLF: 0.8
- Fixtures = (400 × 40) / (4,000 × 0.6 × 0.8) = 8.3 → 9 fixtures
```

### Point-by-Point (Inverse Square)
```
FC = Candlepower / Distance²

For aiming angle:
FC = (CP × cos(angle)) / Distance²
```

### Watts per Square Foot (Energy Code)
```
Max Watts = Area (SF) × LPD (W/SF)

Example:
- 1,000 SF office
- LPD allowed: 0.98 W/SF
- Max watts: 980W
- If using 15W fixtures: max 65 fixtures
```

## Switching and Controls

### Residential Switching
| Room | Switch Location |
|------|-----------------|
| Entry | At door, 3-way to interior |
| Hall | 3-way at each end |
| Bedroom | At door, 3-way to bed |
| Kitchen | Multiple switches by zone |
| Bathroom | At door, separate for fan |
| Garage | At house door + car door |
| Exterior | At door, photocell optional |

### Commercial Controls (IECC Required)
| Control | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Occupancy sensors | Required in most spaces |
| Daylight sensors | Required at skylights, sidelighting |
| Multi-level switching | 50% reduction capability |
| Automatic shut-off | Required for spaces > 5,000 SF |
| Time scheduling | Commercial buildings |

### Dimming Guidelines
| Space Type | Dimming | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Conference | Yes | 3+ preset levels |
| Dining | Yes | Full range |
| Lobby | Yes | Scenes for time of day |
| Office | Optional | Task vs ambient |
| Corridor | No | Not typically needed |
| Retail | Varies | Display vs general |
