## Directional Signage

### Wayfinding Hierarchy
1. **Primary** - Major destinations (lobby, elevator, parking)
2. **Secondary** - Departments, zones
3. **Tertiary** - Individual rooms
4. **Regulatory** - Code-required signs

### Sign Types
| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| Directory | Building map, tenant list |
| Directional | Arrows to destinations |
| Identification | Room/department name |
| Informational | Rules, hours, policies |
| Regulatory | Fire exit, no smoking |

### Placement Principles
- Decision points (intersections, elevators)
- Consistent mounting height
- Clear sight lines
- Not blocked by doors or obstructions
- Adequate lighting

---

## Room Identification Signs

### Standard Information
- Room number
- Room name/function
- Department (optional)
- Tactile text and Braille (if permanent)

### Numbering Systems
| System | Example | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Sequential | 101, 102, 103 | Simple buildings |
| Zoned | 1A01, 1B01 | Wings/zones |
| Grid | 1-A-101 | Large buildings |
| Landmark | Near main lobby | Wayfinding assist |

### Standard Sizes
| Application | Typical Size |
|-------------|--------------|
| Office | 4" × 8" |
| Conference | 4" × 10" |
| Restroom | 4" × 8" or 6" × 6" |
| Suite | 8" × 10" |
| Department | 10" × 12" |

## Directory Signs

### Types
| Type | Use |
|------|-----|

| Floor-based | Building map per floor |
| Departmental | By function |
| Interactive (digital) | Large/complex buildings |

### Design Considerations
- Viewing distance affects text size
- Clear organization
- Easy to update (changeable)
- Coordinate with building numbering
- Include "You Are Here" if map
