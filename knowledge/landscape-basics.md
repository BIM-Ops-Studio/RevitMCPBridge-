## Site Grading

### Grading Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Positive drainage | Slope away from buildings |
| Minimum slope | 2% for turf, 1% for paving |

| Swales | 2% minimum longitudinal |
| Sheet flow | 5% maximum |

### Slopes for Different Uses
| Use | Maximum Slope |
|-----|---------------|

| Accessible routes | 5% running, 2% cross |
| Ramps | 8.33% (1:12) |
| Parking areas | 5% |
| Driveways | 10-15% |

### Cut and Fill
| Consideration | Guideline |
|---------------|-----------|
| Balance | Minimize import/export |
| Existing trees | Avoid grade changes at drip line |
| Foundation | Minimum 8" below slab |
| Utility clearances | Per utility requirements |
| Retaining | Required for slopes > 2:1 |

### Drainage Structures
| Structure | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Swales | Convey surface water |
