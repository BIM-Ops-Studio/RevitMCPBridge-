# Coordination Workflows

## Structural Coordination

### Grid Lines
1. Grids must match EXACTLY between Architectural and Structural
2. Grid bubbles at same locations
3. Grid naming convention consistent (1,2,3... and A,B,C...)

### Items Requiring Structural Input
- Floor openings larger than 12"x12"
- Stair openings
- Elevator shafts
- Mechanical shafts
- Roof equipment over 500 lbs
- Canopies and overhangs
- Skylights in structure

### Structural Notes to Include
Add note on architectural plans:
```
CONTRACTOR SHALL VERIFY ALL STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS
WITH STRUCTURAL DRAWINGS. STRUCTURAL DRAWINGS SHALL
GOVERN FOR ALL STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS.
```

### Embed Coordination
When placing elements in concrete:
1. Identify all embeds needed
2. Provide embed schedule or callouts
3. Note: "COORDINATE EXACT LOCATION WITH STRUCTURAL"
4. Show on plan with offset dimensions

## MEP Coordination

### Plumbing
1. Fixture locations must be exactly placed
2. Show plumbing walls (thicker for piping)
3. Note floor drains and cleanouts
4. Coordinate water heater location
5. Show hose bibs on elevations

### Fixture Rough-In Dimensions
| Fixture | From Wall | From Side Wall |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Toilet | 12" CL | 15" min clearance |
| Lavatory | 4" | Varies |
| Shower valve | 52" AFF | Centered |
| Tub spout | 4" above tub | 4" from corner |

### Electrical
1. Show panel locations on plans
2. Note dedicated circuits:
   - HVAC equipment
   - Water heater (if electric)
   - Kitchen appliances
   - Garage door openers
3. Coordinate outlet locations with casework

### HVAC
1. Show equipment locations (AHU, condensers)
2. Note access requirements:
   - Service clearance (typically 30")
   - Filter access
   - Coil pull space
3. Coordinate ceiling heights with duct routing
4. Note thermostat locations

### Ceiling Coordination
Before finalizing ceiling heights:
1. Check duct depths with MEP
2. Verify sprinkler head locations
3. Confirm light fixture layout
4. Check diffuser/grille locations
