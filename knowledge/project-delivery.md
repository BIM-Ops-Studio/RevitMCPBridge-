## Design-Bid-Build (DBB)

### Process
```
1. Design Phase (100% complete)
2. Bidding Phase (competitive bids)
3. Construction Phase
```

### Characteristics
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Contracts | Separate A/E and contractor |
| Pricing | Lump sum bid |
| Competition | Price-based |
| Design completion | 100% before bidding |
| Change orders | Common if design incomplete |

### Advantages
- Maximum price competition
- Clear scope at bid
- Design fully controlled
- Familiar to all parties
- Often required for public projects

### Disadvantages
- Longest duration
- No contractor input on design
- Adversarial relationships
- Change orders if incomplete docs
- No schedule overlap

### Typical Timeline
| Phase | Duration (% of total) |
|-------|----------------------|
| Design | 30-40% |
| Bidding | 5-10% |
| Construction | 50-60% |

---

## Design-Build (DB)

### Process
```
1. Program/RFP Development
2. DB Team Selection
3. Design + Construction (overlapping)
```

### Characteristics
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Contracts | Single point of responsibility |
| Pricing | Lump sum or GMP |
| Competition | Qualifications and price |
| Design | By DB team |
| Risk | Transferred to DB team |

### Advantages
- Single point of responsibility
- Faster schedule (overlap phases)
- Early cost certainty
- Reduced change orders
- Contractor input on constructability

### Disadvantages
- Less design control for owner
- Difficult to compare proposals
- May sacrifice design quality
- Requires clear program/criteria
- Owner needs strong criteria docs

### Selection Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Best value | Qualifications + price |
| Two-step | Qualifications first, then price |
| Negotiated | Single qualified team |
| Bridging | Partial design before DB selection |

### Bridging
```
1. Design Criteria Architect develops 15-35% design
2. DB teams respond to bridging documents
3. DB team completes design and builds
```

## Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR)

### Process
```
1. Owner hires CM early
2. Design proceeds with CM input
3. CM provides GMP at appropriate phase
4. CM manages construction as general contractor
```

### Characteristics
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Contracts | A/E + CM (separate) |
| Pricing | GMP with shared savings |
| CM role | Pre-construction + construction |
| Risk | Shared (GMP limits CM risk) |
| Competition | Multiple bid packages |

### Pre-Construction Services
| Service | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Cost estimating | Real-time budgeting |
| Constructability review | Design improvements |
| Value engineering | Cost savings |
| Schedule development | Realistic timelines |
| Bid package planning | Trade coordination |

### GMP Timing
| Phase | GMP Accuracy |
|-------|--------------|
| Schematic (30%) | ±15-20% |
| DD (60%) | ±10-15% |
| CD (90%) | ±5-10% |
| 100% CD | ±3-5% |

### Advantages
- CM input during design
- GMP limits owner cost exposure
- Fast-track possible
- Trade contractor competition
- Shared savings incentive

### Disadvantages
- Less price competition for CM
- Early CM selection before scope clear
- GMP negotiations can be difficult
- Split responsibilities (A/E vs CM)

## Multi-Prime (Separate Contracts)

### Process
```
1. Design by A/E
2. Bid separate packages (general, mechanical, electrical, etc.)
3. Owner holds all prime contracts
4. Owner or CM coordinates
```

### Characteristics
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Contracts | Multiple primes with owner |
| Coordination | Owner responsibility |
| Risk | High for owner |
| Pricing | Competitive per trade |
| Use | Often required for public |

### Typical Prime Contracts
| Package | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| General | Structure, envelope, finishes |
| HVAC | Heating, cooling, ventilation |
| Plumbing | Piping, fixtures |
| Electrical | Power, lighting, low voltage |
| Fire protection | Sprinklers, alarms |

### Advantages
- Maximum trade competition
- Owner controls all contracts
- Can fast-track
- May satisfy public bidding laws

### Disadvantages
- Owner assumes coordination risk
- No single point of responsibility
- Schedule delays from disputes
- Requires sophisticated owner

## Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)

### Process
```
1. Multi-party agreement (Owner, A/E, Contractor)

```

### Characteristics
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
