# Ceiling Systems

## Ceiling Type Selection

### Decision Tree
```
What is the use?
  Office/Commercial → ACT or drywall
  Residential → Drywall or exposed
  Industrial → Exposed structure
  Wet areas → Moisture-resistant

What is the budget?
  Economy → ACT (lay-in)
  Mid-range → Tegular ACT or basic drywall
  Premium → Specialty ACT, wood, or detailed drywall

Is MEP access needed?
  Frequent access → ACT (lay-in)
  Occasional → ACT tegular or access panels in drywall
  Minimal → Drywall
```

## Open/Exposed Ceilings

### When to Use
- Industrial/loft aesthetic
- High ceilings (14'+ economical)
- Sustainability (less material)
- Flexibility (exposed access)

### What to Address
- Structure painted or sealed
- MEP systems organized and painted
- Acoustic treatment (baffles, spray-on, clouds)
- Fire sprinkler coverage
- Lighting (pendant, track, surface)
